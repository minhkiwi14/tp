## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with one another.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete /id A0111111N`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />
<br>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete /id A0123456N")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete /id A0123456N` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1200" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Note` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Note` object per unique note, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Note` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This sections describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### File Save Feature

**API** : [`FileCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FileCommand.java)

The file save feature allows users to save the current state of the address book to a specified file in the `data` directory. This ensures that users can maintain multiple save files for different contexts (e.g., different classes or groups). The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the system when the `file /save` command is executed.

The following sequence is illustrated below.

<puml src="diagrams/FileSaveSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

<br>

### File Load Feature

**API** : [`FileCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FileCommand.java)

The file load feature allows users to load a previously saved state of the address book from a specified file in the `data` directory. This enables users to switch between different save files seamlessly. The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the system when the `file /load` command is executed.

The following sequence is illustrated below

<puml src="diagrams/FileLoadSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

<br>

### Histogram feature

**API** : [`Histogram.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Histogram.java)

The histogram feature shows users a distribution of the grades of the students in the address book as a histogram. The sequence diagram below illustrates how the histogram gets updated when details in the address book change.

<puml src="diagrams/HistogramSequenceDiagram.puml" width="900" />

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed Implementation**

This section describes how certain features might be implemented.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

  2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
     Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

  1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list, one with the `Id` of `A0237297R` and none with the `Id` of `A9999999R`.

  2. Test case: `delete /id A0237297R`<br>
     Expected: Contact with `Id` of `A0237297R` is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

  3. Test case: `delete /id A9999999R`<br>
     Expected: Assume contact with `Id` of `A9999999R` does not exist. No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

  4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete 69`,
     Expected: Similar to previous


### Visualizing Grade Histogram.

1. Add a person from an empty save file
  * Test case: `add /id A0000001R /name teststudent`

2. Edit the person with the `/grade` flag with the `edit` command.
  * Test case: `edit /id A0000001R /grade 100`
  * Expected: The histogram will be updated and will show 1 student under [90-100] in the histogram.

3. Delete the person
  * Test case: `delete /id A0000001R`
  * Expected: The histogram will be updated to become empty as there are no students in the list.


### Save and Load from a Save File

1. Save the current list of students to a save file.
  * Test case `file /save CS2103T-T10`
  * Expected: A file `CS2103T-T10.json` will be created in `data/` directory.

2. Exit the application with the `exit` command.

3. Relaunch the application with `java -jar BetterCallTA.jar` from the command line terminal.
  *  Expected: BetterCallTA will load successfully.

4. Load the application with the Load command.
  * Test Case: `file /load CS2103T-T10`

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size : 5**

This section contains Planned Enhancements of future enhancements for BetterCallTA. This section is immune from PE bug reporting, as you should know (for us to award you your PE marks. We want to help you as well, but will not if we deem your report too unreasonable).

**1. Do additional error checking in the edge case whereby there are no data save files already in the <code>data</code> directory.**

* Currently, there will be no error message thrown if the <code>data</code> directory is empty, and the BetterCallTA will fail to load a save file until a user is added into the application. We plan to add a validation to ensure that a descriptive error message is shown to the user in this case as there is currently no feedback.

**2.  Add additional commands for adding, deleting, and clearing of individual notes.**

* Currently, there is no easy method for individual notes belonging to a student to be edited, modified, and cleared. We plan to add an additional command for the management of student’s notes to be easier.

**3. Command output box is too small**

* Currently, the command output box is too small for certain error messages. We plan to allow users to increase the size of the output box to view more text to enhance user experience.

**4. Detect when a flag is misspelled and display an error message for it.**

* Currently, there are no detailed error messages in the case that a user misspells a flag, such as mistyping <code>/attendance</code> as <code>/attendence</code>. Adding more detailed error messages (instead of a more general error message in our latest iteration) would allow the user to narrow down the errors in their typed command, improving their CLI experience.

**5. Allow deletion of save files from BetterCallTA**

* Currently, there are no means to delete a save file as saved with the `file /save SAVE_FILE` command. Users would need to manually delete the file on their local system if they wish to do so. In the future, we will introduce means to delete save files in the `data` directory.
